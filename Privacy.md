# What We Do With Your Data
> Updating Cloud Variables

For connections between multiple projects, it is up for SORA to read and write to different cloud variables. Reading can be
done alone, but when you take an action and SORA needs to write, it will put you into Scratch's cloud logs and have your
account take the actions for security reasons. This, because of the way Scratch was made, requires a login of someone's
Scratch <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>. If you do not wish to give away this info, don't consider signing up to SORA.
> Updating SORA's Software

If you use the option of managing your data on your device, you must have the SORA portal Python module installed. Make
sure [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed. Once the module is installed, it will be auto-updated by request of
SORA, meaning it will have access to redownloading itself to your device. These requests request the aforementioned
login.
