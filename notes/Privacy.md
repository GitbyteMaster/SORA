# What We Do With Your Data
> Updating Cloud Variables

For connections between multiple projects, it is up for SORA to read and write to different cloud variables. Reading can be
done alone, but when you take an action and SORA needs to write, it will put you into Scratch's cloud logs and have your
account take the actions for security reasons. This, because of the way Scratch was made, requires a login of someone's
Scratch <b>username</b> and <b>password</b>. If you do not wish to give away this info, don't consider signing up to SORA.
